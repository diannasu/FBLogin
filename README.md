Spent 16hrs

Did:
Tapping in the UITextField repositions the elements, as shown in the screenshots.
Tapping anywhere dismisses the keyboard
If email and password field are both blank, button should be disabled (the alert will show, but the disable is not on)
Password field should be secure with no autocorrection.
After tapping log in button, show the loading indicator in the button. After a 2 second delay, check the password (I have the loading indicator, but there seems to be no delay)
If the password is 'password', transition to the next screen.
If the password is anything else, display the password error alert.

Navigation bar should have the search button and messages button.
Immediately after launch, display the loading indicator.
Long image in a scrollable view.
Add a scrollable view of the "More" page. (optional)
